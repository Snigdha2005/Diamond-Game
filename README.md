Rules:
- Each player gets a suit of cards other than the diamond suit. 
- The diamond cards are then shuffled and put on auction one by one. 
- All the players must bid with one of their own cards face down. 
- The banker gives the diamond card to the highest bid, i.e. the bid with the most points.
2<3<4<5<6<7<8<9<T<J<Q<K<A
- The winning player gets the points of the diamond card to their column in the table. If there are multiple players that have the highest bid with the same card, the points from the diamond card are divided equally among them.
- The player with the most points wins at the end of the game.
